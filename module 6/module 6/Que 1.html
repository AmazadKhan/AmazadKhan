    <h1>Que-1 What is JavaScript?</h1>
    <h2> Ans:- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. <br> (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
        JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, <br> applications, servers, and even games.

It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user interaction, <br> a capability that CSS alone lacks.

JavaScriptâ€™s widespread applications in web, mobile app, and game development make it a valuable language to learn.
