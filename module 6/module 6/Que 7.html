<body><h1><b>Que 7 What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
</b></h1>
<h2> Ans:-The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage content from this end too.  <br>ViewState: It is maintained at only one level that is page-level.</h2>
